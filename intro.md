Welcome to an interactive Jupyter Book for the Magnetic Resonance in Medicine paper by Martin Soellradl et al. entitled "[*Adaptive slice‐specific z‐shimming for 2D spoiled gradient‐echo sequences*](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/mrm.28468)".
It aims to reduce the misbalance between compensation gradients and macroscopic field gradients, by introducing an adaptive slice‐specific z‐shimming approach for 2D spoiled multi‐echo gradient‐echoe sequences in combination with modeling of the signal decay
This Jupyter Book visualizes the results that can be calculated using [their code](https://github.com/neuroimaging-mug/R2s-mapping).The figures are made interactive using [Plotly](https://plotly.com).
